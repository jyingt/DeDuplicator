# DeDuplicator

## Description
Design and implement an efficient data storage locker that utilizes deduplication. Your locker should be able to receive files and store them (for later retrieval) with a minimum storage by storing some common data blocks only once. For example, a first file containing "This is an example" might store all characters, but a second file containing "This is an example too" might store a pointer to the first file followed by " too".
